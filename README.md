# Hey, I'm Sai Jahnavi Damacharla 👋

## Data Science Graduate | AI-ML | GEO-AI | DL-NLP | CLOUD TECH | Research

I'm a Master's graduate in Applied Data Science from IU with Computer Science background, excited for using data to solve real-world problems in healthcare, fintech, transport, business, geospatial and diverse industries.

💻 Seeking opportunities in Data Science & Machine Learning to solve real-world problems.

## 📔 My Inspiration 🚀

My journey into data science began during my undergraduate studies when my math professor asked me to buy a scientific calculator. While searching online, I noticed that soon after, platforms like Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, and Google started showing me targeted ads for calculators. This sparked my curiosity about how data drives personalized recommendations and ultimately led me to explore the Data Science field.

With that inspiration, I started to focus on data science and machine learning.

Since then, I have pursued a Master’s in Applied Data Science at Indiana University, where I have gained expertise across healthcare analytics, urban planning, geospatial intelligence, and business intelligence. My internship at Christopher B. Burke Engineering provided hands-on experience applying deep learning to geospatial challenges, and my research at COMET Lab involved working with geospatial and economic datasets.

I am driven by the potential of data science and machine learning to create meaningful impact whether improving healthcare outcomes, optimizing urban infrastructure, or addressing environmental challenges. I believe that combining machine learning with domain expertise can unlock powerful solutions to some of the hottest problems in technology today.

Spreading my enthusiasm to fellow hungry birds, I also served as a Professional Development Lead in a student-led club at Indiana University. I helped these eager peers craft standout resumes, build compelling portfolios, and navigate the job market across diverse domains feeding their curiosity and ambitions just like I fed mine.
